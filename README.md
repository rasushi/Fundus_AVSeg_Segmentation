# Fundus AVSeg Segmentation

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on **arteryâ€“vein segmentation** in retinal fundus images using the **Fundus-AVSeg** dataset.  
Our aim is to **improve accuracy, sensitivity, and interpretability** of vessel segmentation by leveraging deep learning architectures (e.g., Attention U-Net, transformer-based U-Net) along with advanced loss functions and explainable AI techniques.

Arteryâ€“vein segmentation plays a critical role in **ophthalmology** for diagnosing and monitoring diseases such as:
- Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)
- Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO)
- Hypertensive Retinopathy
- Other vascular and systemic conditions

By providing accurate and interpretable segmentation maps, this project can assist clinicians in **early detection and treatment planning**.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset: Fundus-AVSeg
**Fundus-AVSeg** is a public dataset containing high-resolution color fundus images with **manual annotations** for arteries and veins.  
It includes:
- Retinal fundus images in standard RGB format
- Pixel-wise ground truth masks for artery, vein, and background
- Predefined training, validation, and testing splits

**Key features of the dataset:**
- Images captured using high-quality fundus cameras
- Clear labeling of vessel structures for arteryâ€“vein differentiation
- Designed for benchmarking AV segmentation models

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
1. **Improve Accuracy** â€“ Use advanced architectures (e.g., Attention U-Net, transformer-based variants) and fine-tuned hyperparameters.
2. **Boost Sensitivity** â€“ Focus on small and thin vessel detection using hybrid loss functions like **Dice Loss + Focal Tversky Loss**.
3. **Increase Interpretability** â€“ Integrate explainable AI techniques like **Grad-CAM** and **attention maps** to visualize model decisions.
